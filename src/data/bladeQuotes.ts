  {
    pattern: "P92",
    quote: "Another mid-curve blade, opens up mid way, great for shooting high and builds confidence for beginners who struggle to lift pucks with P88. More difficult to execute backhands due to the more open curve.",
    source: "conwayandbanks.com/blogs/hockey-gear-guide/choosing-the-right-hockey-stick"

  // P28 Quotes
  {
    pattern: "P28",
    quote: "This blade pattern excels at stickhandling, toe drags, and raising the puck. It's ideal for players who shoot off the toe, and it can increase velocity in both the release and the shot.",

  },
  {
    pattern: "P28",

  },
  {
    pattern: "P28",
    quote: "Least friendly pattern for beginners because the blade is designed for snap shots, which is usually more difficult for beginners to master.",
    source: "conwayandbanks.com/blogs/hockey-gear-guide/choosing-the-right-hockey-stick"
  },
  {
    pattern: "P28",
    quote: "The P28 is for those who like to shoot high and dribble a lot as it has a larger and more angled bend at the end of the 'toe'.",
    source: "fixwellhockey.com/en/blogs/hockey/parents-guide-to-buying-the-right-hockey-stick"
  },
  {
    pattern: "P28",
    quote: "The P28 is one of the more widely used patterns in the NHL. Perfect for players who love to use the toe of their blades.",

  {
    pattern: "P88",
    quote: "Very simple blade with a mid-curve, and no opening. Great for stick handling and keeping the puck from flopping. Excellent for backhand shots.",
    source: "conwayandbanks.com/blogs/hockey-gear-guide/choosing-the-right-hockey-stick"
  },
  {
    pattern: "P88",
    quote: "The P88 is my favorite and it is not as angled as the P92 and P28 and the blade is a bit straighter.",
    source: "fixwellhockey.com/en/blogs/hockey/parents-guide-to-buying-the-right-hockey-stick"
  },
  {
    pattern: "P88",
    quote: "Of the common blades, the P88 will be the strongest on the backhand. Its more closed face can make it a bit tougher to raise the puck.",

  },
  {
    pattern: "P88",
